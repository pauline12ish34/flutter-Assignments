state management :sharing application state between screens, across your app.
In Flutter, state management is how your app handles and updates data that can change over time — and makes sure the UI reflects those changes correctly.

state is any data that can change while your app is running.
Examples include Counter value in a button click app, User login status, Items in a shopping cart, Form input values, Theme (dark/light mode). If the data changes and the UI needs to update → that’s state.

This is awritten assignment  I referred some of the snippet from my prev project of notes_management_app that was developed by flutter and used provider for state management.
